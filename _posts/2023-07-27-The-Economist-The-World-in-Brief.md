Kinh tế Mỹ tăng trưởng 2.4% trong quý 2, cao hơn mức kỳ vọng của các nhà kinh tế là 1.8%. Mức tăng trưởng này được thúc đẩy bởi mức chi cho tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và sự gia tăng trong đầu tư tư nhân. Khả năng phục hồi bất ngờ của nền kinh tế Mỹ là tin tốt cho các nhà hoạch định chính sách. Lạm phát cũng được kiềm chế, chỉ số giá tiêu dùng chỉ tăng 3% trong tháng 6, mức tăng thấp nhất trong vòng 2 năm vừa qua. Chủ tịch ngân hàng trung ương Mỹ, ông Jerome Powell nói ngày thứ Tư rằng ông cho rằng Mỹ sẽ không rơi vào suy thoái trong năm nay.

America’s economy grew by 2.4% at an annualised rate in the second quarter, beating economists’ expectations of 1.8%. The increase was spurred by strong consumer spending and a surge in private investment. The surprising resilience of America’s economy is good news for policymakers. Inflation is easing too: consumer prices rose by just 3% in June, the smallest increase in over two years. On Wednesday Jerome Powell, chair of America’s central bank, said that he no longer expects the country to fall into a recession this year.

Niger’s military leadership announced its support for a coup against Mohamed Bazoum, the country’s president. A group of soldiers had announced a takeover on national television on Wednesday; they closed the country’s borders and imposed a nationwide curfew. Mr Bazoum vowed on X (formerly Twitter) to defend the country’s “hard-won” democracy. The coup will complicate Western efforts to help Niger stem attacks by insurgent groups in the country.

The European Central Bank raised interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, taking its benchmark rate to 3.75%—its highest in over two decades. Although inflation in Europe is easing, the bank did not rule out further rate hikes. In June the annual inflation figure was 5.5%, down from an all-time peak of 10.6% in October 2022.

Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, pledged to deliver between 25-50,000 tonnes of free grain each to six African countries in the coming months. In his opening speech at the Russia-Africa summit Mr Putin defended his recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative. Russia is battling for influence in Africa, but many of the continent’s leaders are unwilling to throw their weight behind the declining global power.

The European Commission launched an antitrust probe into Microsoft over the bundling of Teams, a conferencing service, with its other products. These include Office 365, a web-based suite for businesses. The investigation into “anti-competitive tying” follows a complaint by Slack, a messaging app. The antitrust investigation is the EU’s first into the American company in more than a decade.

Hafize Gaye Erkan, the governor of Turkey’s central bank, said that inflation in the country could hit 58% by December, up from a previous forecast of 22%. The bank has raised interest rates by a smaller-than-expected nine percentage points in two months, marking a gradual departure from its previous unorthodox economic policy. Ms Erkan predicted that food prices and wages would continue to rise this year.

Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, denounced “new imperialism” in the Pacific during a visit to Vanuatu. America and China have been vying for military power in the region. In May America signed a security pact with Papua New Guinea, the largest of the Pacific islands. During a visit to PNG on Thursday, Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, said that America is “not seeking permanent basing” on the island.
